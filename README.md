# Most Annoying Alarm Clock Ever
*I use my time very effectively ðŸ’€*

## What is this?
Most alarm clocks are incredibly easy to turn off, meaning I usually turn them off and go back to sleep.
Not this one! This is the codebase for my 3d printed alarm clock. The clock is literally superglued to my bedstand, has a battery to ensure that unplugging it does not disable it, with the
only way to turn it off being to get a screwdriver and unscrew the lid. This alarm clock hosts a control panel at `196.168.1.184` locally, allowing the user to set when the
alarm clock will go off. Once the alarm clock goes off, it will give the user a 15 minute grace period after beeping once (the "snooze" period). After that, it will beep consistently, and very annoyingly, every 5 seconds for 30 minutes.
